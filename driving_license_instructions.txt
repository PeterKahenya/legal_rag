How to apply for the new smart Kenyan driving licence

The new NTSA smart digital driving licences was rolled out back in April 2018 and the Government ordered every driver to have it before July 1, 2020.

The licence looks like a national ID and contains the biometric, signature and blood group of the driver. 

However, most drivers don't have the license because they don't know the procedures of applying it but here are things you are required to do to have it.

For you to gain access to NTSA services, the first important step is creating an account with them. Just google tims.ntsa.go.ke/individualRegister and create an account. 

2. Confirm details

3. Make payment
